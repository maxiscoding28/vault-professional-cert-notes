## [Review](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/ops-pro-cert/ops-pro-review)
- Multiple choice questions, hands-on lab scenarios, hybrid (question + terminal)
- You can access Vault documentation (API and Docs) via the browser
- Lab exercises are done in a virtual desktop
- Vault containers are managed with [portainer.io](https://www.portainer.io/)
- Any objective with the word "understand" indicates you will need to conceptually understand the topic but will likely not need to set it up in a lab scenario. One exception to this (possibly) is audit logs.
